# Password Strength Checker with Machine Learning

This project is a **Password Strength Checker** application built using machine learning. The application predicts the strength of a password based on its features and helps users create stronger passwords. The model is trained using a dataset of passwords and their respective strength labels. The project is deployed as a web application using **Streamlit** and is available on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zafermbilen/password-strength-checker).

## Features

- **Real-time password strength analysis** based on the user's input.
- **Machine learning-based prediction** to classify passwords as weak, medium, or strong.
- Deployed on **Streamlit** for easy web interaction.
- Easy to use and interact with the user interface.

## Demo

You can try out the live demo of the app here: [Password Strength Checker on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zafermbilen/password-strength-checker)

## How It Works

The Password Strength Checker uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of passwords. The features of each password (like length, character types, etc.) are extracted and used to classify the password into different strength categories:

- **Weak**
- **Medium**
- **Strong**

The app instantly provides feedback as the user enters the password.
